## 14. Ethical Considerations

### 14.1 Responsible AI

**Principle:** AI systems should be transparent, fair, and accountable

**Implementation:**
- Explain all recommendations in natural language
- Provide confidence scores for uncertainty
- Allow users to override or reject suggestions
- Track and report model biases
- No hidden or deceptive behavior

### 14.2 Privacy

**Principle:** User code is private and should never be shared

**Implementation:**
- All analysis performed locally by default
- No code sent to external servers (except optional OpenAI API)
- Clear opt-in for any telemetry
- Anonymize any shared examples
- Respect intellectual property

### 14.3 Safety

**Principle:** System should not introduce bugs or security issues

**Implementation:**
- Comprehensive verification before applying changes
- Automatic rollback on test failures
- Conservative refactoring (err on side of safety)
- Security-focused agent to catch vulnerabilities
- Regular security audits of system itself

### 14.4 Accessibility

**Principle:** Tool should be usable by developers of all abilities

**Implementation:**
- WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance for web UI
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Color-blind friendly visualizations
- Clear error messages and documentation

### 14.5 Sustainability

**Principle:** Consider environmental impact of AI

**Implementation:**
- Optimize models for efficiency
- Use quantization and pruning
- Provide CPU-only option
- Document carbon footprint
- Encourage local deployment
